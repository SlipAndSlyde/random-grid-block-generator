## Introduction
This project is an extension of: https://github.com/SlipAndSlyde/frameworks/tree/master/block-grid

When refreshed, this project generates a number of random tiles with preset rows and columns. This is a useful framework for projects like Minesweeper.

## Usage
The Grid class is under the grid.js file.

These properties can be changed:
- width
- height
- alpha
- data
- noTiles (corresponds to number of rows and columns)

These methods must be modified:
- refreshDataTiles()
Note: char refers to the symbols used in the data attribute

The img.js file must also be modified

Any part of the program is free to use, credit is encouraged
